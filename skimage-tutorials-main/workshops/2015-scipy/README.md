the root directory. For example, in a command terminal, type:

    cd path/to/skimage-tutorials
    ipython notebook


Then, open up the notebook named `index.ipynb` and follow the link to SciPy
2015. Individual lecture notebooks are linked from there.


Find solved notebooks in the ``lectures/solutions`` directory. Exercise solutions
for sections 0, 1, and 2 are compiled in the `012_solutions.ipynb` notebook.
