* Support material for the tutorial _3D image processing with scikit-image_.

This tutorial will introduce how to analyze three dimensional stacked and volumetric images in Python, mainly using scikit-image. Here we will learn how to:
  * pre-process data using filtering, binarization and segmentation techniques.
  * inspect, count and measure attributes of objects and regions of interest in the data.
  * visualize large 3D data.
