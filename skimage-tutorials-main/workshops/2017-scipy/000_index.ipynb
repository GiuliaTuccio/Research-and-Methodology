    "Across domains, modalities, and scales of exploration, images form an integral subset of scientific measurements. Despite a deep appeal to human intuition, gaining understanding of image content remains challenging, and often relies on heuristics (we hope to address some of that in part 3!). Even so, the wealth of knowledge contained inside of images cannot be understated, and <a href=\"http://scikit-image.org\">scikit-image</a>, along with <a href=\"http://scipy.org\">SciPy</a>, provides a strong foundation upon which to build algorithms and applications for exploring this domain.\n",
