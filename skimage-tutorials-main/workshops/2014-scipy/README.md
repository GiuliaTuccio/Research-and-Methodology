scikit-image tutorial at SciPy 2014
===================================

This directory contains the materials for the scikit-image tutorial given
at [SciPy 2014](https://conference.scipy.org/scipy2014/schedule/tutorials/) by
Juan Nunez-Iglesias and Tony Yu, titled "Image analysis in Python with scipy
and scikit-image".

After cloning or downloading this repo, start an IPython notebook server in
this directory. For example, in a command terminal, type:

    cd path/to/skimage-tutorials/scipy-2014
    ipython notebook


Then, open up the notebook title `000_index.ipynb`, which gives links to the
notebooks for each section.

Find solved notebooks in the "solved" directory. Exercise solutions for
sections 0, 1, and 2 are not included in completed notebooks but rather
compiled in the `solutions_012.ipynb` notebook.
